Right out the gate, this season is pulling no punches. It has a little dash of a <br>
 Dangerous Game, a hint of Ready or Not, and maybe some Knives Out thrown in. <br>
 The fourth season follows the wealthy but dysfunctional Galloway family that has <br>
 become together for their annual family reunion. Of course, the reunion takes place <br>
  on a secluded island. As viewers learn, the patriarch of the family Spencer Galloway <br>
 (David Cronenberg) has a penchant for cruelty. This manifests itself the most with a series <br>
  of brutal competitive games between family members for a prize. This year’s reunion features <br>
 the return of these games. The prize? The entire Galloway inheritance. If that weren’t stressful enough,<br>
  there is a masked killer hunting people down.

 maybe just spawned a new executioner. At the center of the story is a group of <br>

      During a 12-hour period when all crime -- including murder -- is legal,<br>

 embrace what it means to purge to its fullest extent -- whether for revenge,<br>

  to reckon with his or her past and plot how to better their futures, <br>
  they soon discover how far they will go on Purge Night.<br>
